      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t recall what made me borrow this book from my local library: The Elements of Style, by William Strunk Jr. and E.B. White. On &amp;ldquo;An approach to style&amp;rdquo; section I&amp;rsquo;ve found a couple of interesting rules that struck a chord, as those are things we, business analysts, should have in mind while communicating our work to others.
Be clear  Clarity is not the prize in writing, nor is it always the principal mark of a good style.</description>
