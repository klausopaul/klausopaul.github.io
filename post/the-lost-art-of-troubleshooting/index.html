Or at least, that is what is seems to me.</p><p>On my first week as a software tester, back in the day, the team received report that the web site had an issue and it was preventing customers from placing orders. It was a all-hands-on-deck moment and the team got to work to try and reproduce the problem in our testing environment; standard procedure you can say. However, the other testers in the team, while more knowledgeable in the system than I, were all over the place trying to pinpoint the root cause. To me, who always liked scientific experiments, the steps taken were akin to have no control group, with multiple variables being modified at once. Once we isolated the number of moving data points, the reason for the problem was quickly identified and the development team was able to bring the website back up again.</p><p>Fast forward to 2010, when I found out about this book, <a href=https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance target=_blank>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</a></p><p>It has been 8 years since I finished that book, and I may have got the wrong message, however, what struck me the most were the parts where the protagonist talked about his motorcycle, and how each part of it had its own function and how they worked together to make the motorcycle work.</p><p>In other words: systemic view and functional decomposition. And most importantly, to fix a motorcycle one needs to observe what the symptoms are, make hypotheses, test one (not several) at a time, until the root cause is found and it is time to start thinking of a solution.</p><p>In recent projects I worked on, more than once people came to me with a vague, unclear statement: &ldquo;It is not working.&rdquo;.</p><p>That&rsquo;s it. &ldquo;It is not working&rdquo;.</p><p>Invariably, I was in the middle of something, so, I stop that (interruption already causing the damage), and switch my attention to the issue at hand. First question: &ldquo;what is not working?&rdquo;. The answer is another vague and unclear statement.</p><p>If I am lucky to be in the same room, or close to where the person is located (walking-distance), I go to their place and ask to show me what is wrong. In most cases, they are not even close to beginning to analyze the situation. So I start  asking questions.</p><p>9 out of 10 times, the reason for the problem is either in a log file or in the actual data being used. For that 1 out of 10, a little more digging and the root cause is found.</p><p>It may sound harsh, but we are not on the business of building rockets. It is always, always, data going from A to B, through channel X, inside a predefined envelope Y.</p><p>In the book, motorcycle problems are traced back from symptom to root cause, through careful examination of the issue and any other clues that the vehicle gives you. Is it a time consuming process? Definitely. Can it find the root cause of issues? Again, definitely.</p><p>My advice: don&rsquo;t freak out at the first sight of a problem. Take a deep breath, and start the investigation using whatever you have at hand: logs, error messages, etc. When you exhausted the options, ask for help. One might ask you things that you have already checked, but at least, that will save time.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=tags><svg class="icon" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 0 1-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59A2 2 0 0 1 20.59 13.41z"/><path d="M7 7V7z"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags: </span><a class=tag href=/tags/>Tags</a></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/post/the-parable-of-the-two-young-fish/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20 12H4z"/><path d="M10 18 4 12l6-6"/></svg>Previous</span>
