A short disclaimer: I&rsquo;ve never served in the army, but if you have, perhaps you can help me correct my understanding. If, however, movie advisors did a good job, then I have found a good way to remember the reasons for a kick-off meeting in an Agile project, as well as, what that meeting entails.</p><h3 id=first-advice-when-to-hold-the-meeting>First advice: When to hold the meeting</h3><p>Mike&rsquo;s first advice is to hold a kick-off meeting whenever 3 things happen: major initiative, new team members, once a year.</p><p>Compare that to what we see in movies. The team leader always holds a meeting to tell his comrades what their most important goal is, be it rescue a friend from a foreign prison, or blow stuff up :)</p><h3 id=second-advice-who-should-participate-in-the-meeting>Second advice: Who should participate in the meeting</h3><p>In the movies you will rarely see big wigs for the entirety of above meeting. They might show up at the beginning or the end of the meeting, but usually they don&rsquo;t attend the entire meeting. As Mike mentioned, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not a good use of their valuable time.&rdquo;</p><p>What about other team members? It depends how involved they will be in the project. In the movies that is when the rogue airplane pilot meets the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; half-way through the movie and it is told to fly low from their point A to point B and avoid open spaces. That is an important task to ensure the overall project is successful, but clearly the airplane pilot doesn&rsquo;t know everything else (and he/she doesn&rsquo;t need to), what leads us to the next advice: the meeting agenda</p><h3 id=third-advice-the-meeting-agenda>Third advice: the meeting agenda</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s the advice that triggered me to relate the kick-off meetings to action movies. In Mike&rsquo;s opinion, the agenda for the kick-off meeting consists of the following points:</p><ul><li>Introductions</li><li>Scope / Deliverables</li><li>Core and Desired Capabilities</li><li>Collaboration & Communication Plan</li><li>Risks</li><li>Wrap Up</li></ul><p>While I am not suggesting to approach the agenda the same way the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; approach it in the action movies, the similarities are noteworthy. Let&rsquo;s see.</p><h3 id=introductions>Introductions</h3><p>I not remember one movie where either the character, or the lead character, introduces someone as just as &ldquo;good with guns&rdquo;. There is quite often some larger but concise introduction, similar to what Mike exemplifies in his article as a good, simple way to introduce one-self to a team: <em>“I did a lot of the coding on the medical records part of the system. I helped a little on patient search screens. And I helped Ashish get some automated testing in place for some of the old code.”</em></p><h3 id=scope--deliverables>Scope / Deliverables</h3><p>Just read this example from Mike and compare it, or try to remember, one case from any action movie, and you notice interesting common points:</p><p><em>“I really want to have enough support for tables that we can release that and start getting feedback on the new table design. We don’t need everything for tables done but enough that we all agree it’s releasable. I think we also need to be done with the caching and other performance work we’ve talked about. If we can’t get to 100%, though, the remaining performance work is low enough priority that we can put it off for 3-6 more months after this.”</em></p><p>For example, if I were to write something similar to that, but for my team of soldiers:</p><p><em>&ldquo;I want us to rescue personality X from the hands of the evil dictator YYD. I want us to infiltrate the compound at night, don&rsquo;t make much noise, release the prisoner, and return to our base. If we find ourselves in a tough spot, make as much noise and mayhem as possible. We have 72 hours to get in, bring back the prisoner alive, and be back here with zero casualties on our side."</em></p><h3 id=success>Success</h3><p>This is simply writing down, figuratively or not, what will make the mission, or project a success. In my movie plot, the success criteria are two:  bring back the prisoner alive, and zero casualties on the team.</p><p>On a more &ldquo;standard&rdquo; project, the success can be defined using criteria such as, but not limited to, a date, a set of features, or any other criteria defined and agreed upon by the entire team.</p><h3 id=core-and-desired-capabilities>Core and Desired Capabilities</h3><p>Here&rsquo;s where each team member core capabilities are presented to the viewer: explosives, airplane pilot, use of knives, etc.</p><p>In our office setting, this would be, for example, <em>&rdquo;&mldr;my core capabilities are writing Java code, working with the database, and testing. For any work of that nature, I’m available."</em></p><h3 id=collaboration--communication-plan>Collaboration & Communication Plan</h3><p>In the movies this is when the team establishes how they will work together, and how they will communicate between each other (no radio, for example), and with the base (radio is exempted until certain milestones are achieved).</p><p>To us, this might be things like regular iteration review will happen every Thursday at 3 P.M. It also includes tools used for communication (email, messaging tools, etc.), time one will be available for iterations, the length of team&rsquo;s iterations, etc.</p><h3 id=risks>Risks</h3><p>Any endeavor, big or small, will have risks associated. Our group of mercenaries may fly to their target location on a airplane that is holding itself together with paper clips and bubble gum, and there is a risk they will be detected even before crossing the border to the imaginary location.</p><p>During the kick-off meeting, come up with the top 10 risks, document then, and move on. Track those, and during the subsequent iteration meetings, crossed them off, add new, and prepare mitigation strategies, if necessary.</p><h3 id=wrap-up>Wrap Up</h3><p>&ldquo;Does everybody understand the plan?&rdquo; is the usual line of the team leader in the movies.</p><p>In real life, we have to be more polite: thank everyone for participating, and ensure the participant&rsquo;s expectations were met. If not, try and fix that on the spot, or take it on another meeting.</p><h3 id=summary>Summary</h3><p>Everybody likes a good movie, with a good, engaging plot. We might even ignore some plot holes because we found the story so interesting that we prefer to believe in it.</p><p>So, to me, thinking in story terms may seem a better way to visualize the work that needs to get done, how to approach that work, and also, it may help in persuading people to value the &ldquo;project plot&rdquo; the same way we do.</p></div><footer class=entry-footer><div class="container sep-before"><div class=tags><svg class="icon" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><path d="M20.59 13.41l-7.17 7.17a2 2 0 01-2.83.0L2 12V2H12l8.59 8.59A2 2 0 0120.59 13.41z"/><line x1="7" y1="7" x2="7" y2="7"/></svg><span class=screen-reader-text>Tags:</span></div></div></footer></article><nav class=entry-nav><div class=container><div class="prev-entry sep-before"><a href=/post/potentially-releasable-product/><span aria-hidden=true><svg class="icon" viewbox="0 0 24 24" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" aria-hidden="true"><line x1="20" y1="12" x2="4" y2="12"/><polyline points="10 18 4 12 10 6"/></svg>Previous</span>
